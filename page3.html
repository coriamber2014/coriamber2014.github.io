      <h2 class="petuna">So, let's begin. AHEM! The story of the WEPEEs and ECs all began when...</h2>
      <p class="petuna">one day, Santa had asked EBE to peer edit a document for school. Except, instead of working, those two decided to procrasinate. Procrasination is bad kids! Anyways, I think it was EBE who immaturely decided to start copying in pig pictures and weird photos-</p>
      <p class="tuna">*BULB BULB BUBBLE BUBBLE BURP BELCH BULB BULB* (HELLO!!!!!)</p>
      <p class="petuna">What? We should show them the pictures? Yessssss, good idea. MUHAHAHHAHAHAHHA. I shall hack into EBE's computer and get the photos. Here they are:</p>

      <p class="petuna">So, naturally, WWW decided to fight back. Such immaturity! *Gasp* (Faint)</p>
      <p class="tuna">*BULB!!!!! BULB!!!!!!!!*</p>
      <p class="petuna">Don't worry, I am fine, my dearest tuna. Anyway, Wonton posted sooooooo maaaaannnnnyyyyyy disturbing pictures, that EBE called a trial. They each hired a lawyer. For EBE, it was her dog. For WWW, it was her noodles that she was eating that day. Of course, even before the trial started, Wonton had eaten her "lawyer", so that was tragic. Luckily, Wacky got a new lawyer. Anyway, I...uhh...kind of forgot the rest, hehe, but somewhere, Wobbly stuffed the camel that is part of our team into a trashcan. Such impolitness. The camel swore revenge on Santa Claus, but half way fell in love with the other camel on our team. Of course, the other camel refused his love, so the camel was sad. Then, one day, he accidentally sat on a cactus. The cactus was very evil. It was after then, that there started to be the beginning of the two teams. WEPEE, which had WWW, Weird Wrathful (mysterious name), and EBE, Evil Bossy (another mysterious name). And the other, EC, which had the two camels who reluctantly banded together. Of course, the team names, WEPEE and EC weren't created yet.</p>
      <p class="tuna">*BULB...BULB...*</p>
      <p class="petuna">Don't worry, we'll show up soon. Anyway, sigh, I'm running out of nicknames, that person called WWW was talking to EBE about one of her paticular family members, who they started calling TEFKM, which stood for The Evil (mysterious name) (mysterious name) (mysterious name). My boyfriend! Sighhhhhh (dreamy eyes). Anyway, somehow, TEFKM joined the two camels. And then, I'm not sure if this is what happened, but WWW and EBE felt outnumbered, so they hired three pigs. Three flying pigs. Who constantly demanded potatoes and rebelled against WWW and EBE. However, it was at that time, that WWW and EBE started creating the team names. Our team was called the ECs because the E stood for Evil and the C stood for Camel/(certain family member). At first, they decided to call themselves WE&P, (name) (name) and pigs, but EBE noticed that WE P sounds like WEPEE...sigh...so...the name WEPEE was created. (shakes head). Then one day they decided TEFKM needed a girlfriend, so I showed up. Petuna, and my dear companion, the Tuna. Many plans have been made against us, but the ECs will succeed!</p>
      <p class="tuna">*BULB BULB BUBBLE*</p>
      <p class="petuna">You are absolutely right. We will succeed!!!!! And that concludes the history of WEPEE and ECs until today, 12/10/2017 13:29:59. (bows)</p>
